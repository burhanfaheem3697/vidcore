  What is this middleware doing?
  - It verifies the user's access token before allowing them to access protected routes.

   auth Middleware - Notes: 
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Why check both `cookies` and `Authorization` header?
     - Some clients store tokens in cookies, while others send them in headers.
     - This ensures we support both methods.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Why remove `Bearer ` from the token?
     - Many APIs send tokens in the format `Bearer <token>`.
     - We need only the `<token>` part to verify it.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `.select("-password -refreshToken")`?
     - Security best practice: Never expose sensitive user data.
     - Even though we attach `req.user`, we exclude unnecessary fields.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ What happens if the token is expired?
     - `jwt.verify()` will automatically throw an error if the token is expired.
     - The error message will be passed to `ApiError`, making debugging easier.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `asyncHandler()`?
     - It helps handle asynchronous errors inside Express middleware without needing multiple try-catch blocks.
