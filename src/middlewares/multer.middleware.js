/*
 Multer Storage System - Notes: 

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `multer.diskStorage()` instead of default storage?
     - Default storage saves files in memory (RAM), which is temporary.
     - Disk storage keeps files in a specific directory, making them persist longer.

  ðŸ‘‰ Why use `file.originalname`?
     - It keeps the original filename, making it recognizable for users.
     - If you want unique names, consider appending `Date.now()` to the filename.
